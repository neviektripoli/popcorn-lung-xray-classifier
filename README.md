# Popcorn Lung X-ray Classifier

A deep learning project to detect Bronchiolitis Obliterans (Popcorn Lung) and other related lung diseases (e.g., pneumonia, COPD, pleural effusion) from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

This model aims to assist in the early screening of vape-related lung damage and chronic respiratory illnesses by analyzing radiographic patterns on frontal chest X-rays.

🔬 Key Features
🧠 Trained with CNN-based architecture using PyTorch or TensorFlow

📸 Uses publicly available chest X-ray datasets (e.g., NIH ChestX-ray14, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR)

📊 Multi-label classification for common thoracic pathologies

✅ Supports transfer learning with pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)

🧾 Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC

📁 Clean modular code structure for training, validation, and testing

🌐 Designed for extensibility to new lung diseases or datasets

# ü´Å Popcorn Lung X-ray Classifier

**A Deep Learning Project for Classifying Popcorn Lung (Bronchiolitis Obliterans) and Related Pulmonary Diseases from Chest X-rays.**

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline built in Python to detect Popcorn Lung and other lung conditions (such as Pneumonia, COPD, and general pulmonary abnormalities) using chest X-ray images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model utilizes transfer learning with pretrained backbones (EfficientNet, ResNet) and can be fine-tuned for real-world medical diagnostic support.
